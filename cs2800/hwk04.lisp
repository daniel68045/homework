CS 2800 Homework 4 - Fall 2024

 - Due on Monday, Oct 7 by 11:00 pm.

 - You will have to work in groups. Groups should consist of 2-3
   people. Make sure you are in exactly 1 group!  Use the
   piazza "search for teammates" post to find teammates. Please give
   students who don't have a team a home. If you can't find a team ask
   for help on Piazza.

 - You will submit your hwk via gradescope. Instructions on how to
   do that are on Piazza. If you need help, ask on Piazza.

 - Submit the homework file (this file) on Gradescope. After clicking
   on "Upload", you must add your group members to the submission by
   clicking on "Add Group Member" and then filling their names. Every
   group member can submit the homework and we will only grade the
   last submission. You are responsible for making sure that your
   group submits the right version of the homework for your final
   submission. We suggest you submit early and often.

 For this homework you will need to use ACL2s.

 Technical instructions:

 - Open this file in ACL2s.

 - Make sure you are in ACL2s mode. This is essential! Note that you can
   only change the mode when the session is not running, so set the correct
   mode before starting the session.

 - Insert your solutions into this file where indicated (usually as "XXX")

 - Only add to the file. Do not remove or comment out anything pre-existing.

 - Make sure the entire file is accepted by ACL2s. In particular, there must
   be no "XXX" left in the code. If you don't finish all problems, comment
   the unfinished ones out. Comments should also be used for any English
   text that you may add. This file already contains many comments, so you
   can see what the syntax is.

 - When done, save your file and submit it without changing the name
   of the file.

 - Do not submit the session file (which shows your interaction with
   the theorem prover). This is not part of your solution. Only submit
   the lisp file.

 Instructions for programming problems:

 For all function definitions you must:

 (1) Perform contract-based testing (see Lecture Notes) by adding
     appropriate check=/check tests.  You only have to do this for
     functions where you are responsible for at least some part of the
     definition.  This should be done before you define the function,
     as it is intended to make sure you understand the spec.

     We will use ACL2s' check= function for tests. This is a
     two-argument function that rejects two inputs that do not
     evaluate equal. You can think of check= roughly as defined like
     this:

     (definec check= (x y :all) :bool
       :input-contract (equal x y)
       :output-contract (== (check= x y) t)
       t)

     That is, check= only accepts two inputs with equal value. For
     such inputs, t (or "pass") is returned. For other inputs, you get
     an error. If any check= test in your file does not pass, your
     file will be rejected.

     We will also use ACL2's check function, which is a version of
     check= that checks if a single form evalutes to t, so you can
     think of

     (check X)

     as being equivalent to

     (check= X t)

 (2) For all functions you define provide enough check= tests so that
     you have 100% expression coverage (see Lecture Notes).  You can
     use whatever tests we provide and your contract-based tests to
     achieve expression coverage, e.g., if the union of the tests we
     gave you and your contract-based tests provide 100% expression
     coverage, there is nothing left to do.

 (3) Contract-based testing and expression coverage are the minimal
     testing requirements.  Feel free to add other tests as you see
     fit that capture interesing aspects of the function.

 (4) For all functions where you are responsible for at least some
     part of the definition, add at least two interesting property
     forms. The intent here is to reinforce property-based testing.

 You can use any types, functions and macros listed on the ACL2s
 Language Reference (from class Webpage, click on "Lectures and Notes"
 and then on "ACL2s Language Reference"). 

 Since we don't know how to control the theorem prover, we will
 simplify the interaction with ACL2s somewhat. Instead of requiring
 ACL2s to prove termination and contracts, we allow ACL2s to proceed
 even if a proof fails.  However, if a counterexample is found, ACL2s
 will report it.  See the lecture notes for more information.  This is
 achieved using the following directives (do not remove them):

|#

(set-defunc-termination-strictp nil)
(set-defunc-function-contract-strictp nil)
(set-defunc-body-contracts-strictp nil)
(set-defunc-generalize-contract-thm nil)

#|

 The next form tells ACL2s not to try proving properties, unless
 we explicitly ask. You explicitly ask by adding :proofs? t like this:
 (property (...) :proofs? t ...)

|#

(set-acl2s-property-table-proofs? nil)

#|

 The next form tells ACL2s not to check contracts. If ACL2s does not
 prove function contracts when defining functions, then the property
 form will generate errors if it then tries to reason about the
 contracts of these functions. Instead of asking you to add the
 :check-contracts?  keyword command, we are just turning this testing
 off, which means you may not get as much checking as would otherwise
 be the case, so make sure your properties pass contract checking. If
 you want, you can comment out the next line to get more checking
 from ACL2s and if you run into problems, use the keyword command
 ":check-contracts? nil". Here's an example.

 (property (x :all)
   :check-contracts? nil
   (== (car x) (car x)))

|#

(set-acl2s-property-table-check-contracts? nil)

#|

 Also, we don't want to limit the time definec and counterexample
 generation takes.
 
 You may see some warnings here and there. Just ignore them. As
 long as the output is green, you are good to go.

|#

(set-defunc-timeout 10)
(acl2s-defaults :set cgen-timeout 3)

The Imitation Game Homework.

This homework is about encryption. Not the kind Turing had to deal
with, but with the kind we saw in class.

Consider a very old problem, secure communication.  This field is
called "cryptography" whose etymology originates from the Greek
words "crypto", meaning hidden, and "graphy", meaning writing.  For
example, various city-states in Ancient Greece were known to use
cryptographic methods to send secure messages in the presence of
adversaries.

We will formalize one-time pads, as described in Section of the
lecture notes entitled "The Power of Xor."  This involves writing code
for encrypting and decrypting messages, as well as formalizing and
testing properties that the code should enjoy.

One-time pads allow us to encrypt messages with "perfect" secrecy.
What this means is that if an adversary intercepts an encoded message,
they gain no information about the message, except for an upper bound
on the length of the message. 

If you look at most other types of encryption, e.g., RSA, then with
enough computational resources, an adversary can decrypt encoded
messages. The best known methods for breaking such encryption schemes
take time exponential in the size of the keys used. However, whether
this can be done in polynomial time is an open question.

Many movies have a red telephone that is used to connect the Pentagon
with the Kremlin. While there was no such red telephone, there was a
teletype-based encryption mechanism, the "Washingtonâ€“Moscow Direct
Communications Link," in place between the US and USSR, which used
one-time pads. This connection was established in 1963, following the
Cuban missile crisis.

You can read more about the advantages and disadvantages of one-time
pads by searching online. We will see how to break one-time pads if
one is not careful. 

In fact, the ultimate goal of this exercise is for you to decrypt the
following intercepted secret message. 

|#

;; We intercepted this message and want to decode it. The message was
;; just a sequence of 0's and 1's but our human intelligence
;; determined the character encoding used and characters are encoded
;; using 5 bits, so we tranformed the message into a list of lists of
;; Booleans, each of length 5. 
(def-const *secret-message*
  '((0 1 0 1 0)
    (1 1 1 1 0)
    (1 1 1 0 1)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (0 1 0 0 1)
    (0 1 1 0 1)
    (1 0 0 0 1)
    (1 1 0 1 1)
    (1 0 0 1 1)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 1 0 0 0)
    (0 1 0 0 0)
    (1 0 1 1 1)
    (0 1 1 1 1)
    (1 0 1 0 0)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 1 1 0 0)
    (1 0 1 1 1)
    (0 1 1 1 0)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 0 0 0 0)

    (1 0 1 1 0)
    (1 1 1 0 1)
    (1 1 0 1 0)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 0 1 1 1)
    (0 1 1 0 0)
    (1 1 1 0 1)
    (0 1 0 0 0)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (0 1 0 1 0)
    (1 1 1 1 0)
    (1 1 1 0 1)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 0 0 1 0)
    (1 1 0 0 1)
    (0 0 0 0 0)
    (0 0 0 0 1)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 1 0 1 0)
    (1 0 1 1 1)
    (1 1 1 1 1)
    (0 0 1 0 0)
    (0 1 0 1 1)
    (0 0 0 1 1)
    (1 1 0 0 0)
    (1 1 0 0 1)
    (1 1 0 1 1)
    (1 0 0 1 1)))

 How are we going to decode the encrypted message?

 Well, notice that each encrypted message consists of a list of lists
 of Bits, each of length 5. That is because each list of Bits
 corresponds to a character, as we'll explain shortly.

 But, first we start with some data definitions.

 Below is a data definition for a bit and a list of bits. The name bv
 is an abbreviation for BitVector.

 There is also a data definition for a list of exactly 5 bits.  The
 name bv5 is an abbreviation for BitVector5.

|#

(defdata bit (oneof 0 1))
(defdata bv (listof bit))
(defdata bv5 (list bit bit bit bit bit))

; Note that bv5 is a subtype of bv: every element of bv5 is also an
; element of bv. This is how you state this fact. Think of the form
; below as a kind of property involving data definitions.
(defdata-subtype bv5 bv)

; We define lobv5, a list of bv5's. Something of this type is a
; message.
(defdata lobv5 (listof bv5))

; We also define a list of bv's.
(defdata lobv (listof bv))

; Notice that lobv5 is a subtype of lobv.
(defdata-subtype lobv5 lobv)

;; Question 1
;; Use CHECK to check that *SECRET-MESSAGE* is of type lobv5.
;; Use PROPERTY to check that *SECRET-MESSAGE* is of type lobv5.
;;
;; Notice that PROPERTY is more general than CHECK and CHECK=, as we can always
;; turn a CHECK or CHECK= form into a PROPERTY form, eg given the form
;;     (CHECK exp1)
;; an equivalent PROPERTY form is:
;;     (PROPERTY () exp1)
;; Given the form
;;     (CHECK= exp1 exp2)
;; an equivalent PROPERTY form is:
;;     (PROPERTY () (== exp1 exp2))

(check (lobv5p *secret-message*))

"Property 1"
(property ()
  (lobv5p *secret-message*))

;; Luckily, our human intelligence has learned that the encrypted
;; message is comprised of letters from the following collection
;; of characters.

(def-const *chars*
  '(#\A #\B #\C #\D #\E #\F #\G #\H #\I #\J #\K #\L #\M #\N 
    #\O #\P #\Q #\R #\S #\T #\U #\V #\W #\X #\Y #\Z #\Space 
    #\: #\- #\' #\( #\)))

;; This is a data definition for the legal characters. 
(defdata char (enum *chars*)) 

;; Once decoded, a message will be a list of characters from 
;; *chars*. This is a data definition for a list whose elements are
;; legal characters.
(defdata lochar (listof char))

; We want a mapping (function) from chars to bv5s. Since char is
; finite, we will use an alist. An alist is a true list, whose
; elements are (key . value) conses. Here is the data definition 
; for the mapping.

(defdata char-bv5 (alistof char bv5))

; Here are some check forms.
(check (char-bv5p '((#\G . (0 0 0 0 1)))))

; #\g is not a char!
(check (! (char-bv5p '((#\g . (0 0 0 0 1))))))

; (0 0 0 1) is not a bv5!
(check (! (char-bv5p '((#\G . (0 0 0 1))))))

#|

 Here is the plan for creating this mapping. 

 One option is to just define the mapping directly with a form like
 this: 

 (def-const *bv-char-map*
   '((#\A . (0 0 0 0 0))
     (#\B . (1 0 0 0 0))
     ...))

 The option we will choose is to define the mapping algorithmically
 and in a way that can be used for bit vectors of arbitrary length,
 not just length 5. The company needs this to decrypt other messages 
 that use different encodings.

 Here is the plan.

 We will define a function, generate-bit-vectors, that given a
 natural number, n, will generate all bit vectors of length n.  It has
 to generate them in the following order

 0 ... 0 0 0
 0 ... 0 0 1
 0 ... 0 1 0
 0 ... 0 1 1
 0 ... 1 0 0
 ...

 which you can think of as corresponding to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... .

 We will then use generate-bit-vectors to generate all bit vectors of
 length 5 and will pair them with the chars.
 
 Let's flesh this out some more.

 We start with the definition of generate-bit-vectors and here is
 the plan for doing that. generate-bit-vectors will be a
 non-recursive function that first creates a list of n 0s, using the
 function n-copies, and then calls a helper function,
 generate-bit-vectors-aux, with the list of n 0s and the number
 of bit vectors of length n. 

 So we have to now define n-copies and generate-bit-vectors-aux. 

 The function generate-bit-vectors-aux is given a bit vector, v,
 and a nat, n, as input and it generates an n-element list of bit 
 vectors, starting with v, followed by the next bit vector in the 
 ordering above, and so on.  If you get to the last bitvector (1 1 ... 1), 
 wrap around and continue with (0 0 ... 0). 

 The function next-bv is responsible for computing the next bit
 vector.

|#

;; Question 2
;; Define next-bv, using the above specification.
;; Make sure to add tests and properties as described in the
;; instructions for all definitions, including for helper functions.
;; I used a helper function in my solution.

;; Helper function to handle the carry (recursive)
(definec next-bv-helper (b :bv) :bv
  (if (endp b)                 ;; Base case: if the list is empty, return an empty list
      nil
      (if (= (first b) 0)      ;; If the first bit is 0, set it to 1 and stop
          (cons 1 (rest b))
          (cons 0 (next-bv-helper (rest b)))))) ;; If the first bit is 1, set it to 0 and carry over

;; Properties for next-bv-helper

;; Property 1: next-bv-helper preserves the length of the bit vector
(property (b :bv)
  :test? t
  (equal (len (next-bv-helper b)) (len b)))

;; Property 2: next-bv-helper returns a valid bit vector
(property (b :bv)
  :test? t
  (bvp (next-bv-helper b)))

;; Question 20
;;
;; Well, what is the secret message?  (The answer is the one string
;; out of the 32 strings returned by game-over that makes any sense.)

(defconst *the-secret-message-is*
  XXX)

;; This is a historically relevant message. Look it up and explain
;; why it is historically relevant in the string below.

;; Extra Credit 
;;
;; It is easy enough to look at all of the potential secret messages,
;; since there are only 32 of them, in order to figure out what the
;; most likely message is. But, you are a perfectionist and came up
;; with a plan to facilitate the process. Your plan is to order the
;; messages by counting the number of spaces, E's and T's in the
;; message since these are the most common characters in English text,
;; statistically speaking. So, define a function that returns the list
;; generated by game-over, but ordered as described above.  This
;; requires that you do some investigation, using the ACL2s
;; documentation, to figure out how to access characters in strings,
;; etc. You can use any ACL2s functions you want here, not just the
;; ones in the reference guide.
